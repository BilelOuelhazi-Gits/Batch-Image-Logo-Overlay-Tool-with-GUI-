# Batch-Image-Logo-Overlay-Tool-with-GUI-
This is a simple Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter that allows users to batch overlay a logo onto a folder of images. The app resizes the logo to match the width of each image and places it at the bottom. It's ideal for watermarking or branding multiple images at once. The final images are saved in a separate res folder inside the selected directory.

Features:

Easy-to-use graphical interface

Batch process images in a selected folder

Automatically resizes and positions the logo

Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats

Saves results in a non-destructive way
